1. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your
attached code? If so, explain. (note that you will get half credit for any
reasonably sized bug that is fully explained in the readme)
- No known issues are present in the code

2. Collaboration: Who did you collaborate with on this project? What resources and
references did you consult? Please also specify on what aspect of the project you
collaborated or consulted.
- We collaborated with no other groups or referenced code from any site. 

3. What are some interesting questions about mortgages in NJ your database can
answer?
- Did male and female applicants get approved at different rates?
- What is the average loan amount approved for this year?
- Percentage of approved loan applicants to those who were denied?
- When lenders denied the most loans?

4. What problems did you face developing code for this project? Around how long did
you spend on this project (This helps me decide what I need to explain more clearly
for the next projects)
- The issue we spent the most time on was when it was time to split the information up into their respective normalized tables. We faced issues when
  of the data would not generate into the table or when tables would just appear blank. Converting the blank spaces on the csv file into null was
  a little confusing at first but it took us approximately a week to get this project done. 

5. If you prefer, you can turn in your videos here as links instead of uploading
them to canvas. These links must remain live until you recieve your final grade in
this course, and should include some dating indication such as upload date to show
they were done before the deadline.
